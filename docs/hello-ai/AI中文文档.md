## Overview

Aiming to connect oneself and others to the vast world of AI, this project was created with just that intention in mind.

As one of the forerunners in the advent of AI, during the peak popularity of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), this initiative provided a series of public AI services, helping some people connect to the world of AI. Time flies, and nowadays, AI is everywhere, and the public services offered have stopped for various reasons. However, the original intention of this project remains. If you're tired of dealing with domestic services that are just shells, sporadically operational, or vanish without a trace, this site may still offer you some assistance.

The project provides AI-related resources, including but not limited to:

- [ChatGPT in Chinese: A Guide](./home/chatgptPrompts.md)
- [Collection of Open Source ChatGPT Projects](./home/awesome-open-gpt.md)
- [A Compilation of Global AI Websites](./home/navigation.md)
- Trending AI News
- AI Information Exchange Groups, etc.

The project is maintained during business hours, so there might be omissions, errors, or suboptimal experiences, but the author will strive to continually optimize and improve.

If you have any AI-related information to provide or have suggestions or feedback, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/xxxily/hello-ai/issues).
